# NextItem (WIP)

NextItem provides suggestions to the user (i.e. me) for things to do during doldrums. Currently it involves a static list of  activities that can be edited in memory (training exercise).

Devices and orientation: should run on currently supported iPhones and iPads in a portrait-only orientation.

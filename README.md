# Nudge Me

## Description

Orange Noise Production Company (orangenoiseproduction.com) is glad to provide Nudge Meâ€”an app designed to offset human inertia for people who respond well to suggestions (that they've created). It addresses the doldrums. It comes with a list of generic suggestions that can be (a) edited, (b) deleted, and (c) restored again.

In addition to suggestions are three filters: --needs revision
1. Frequency with which the suggestion should appear (low, medium, high)
2. Time of day at which suggestion should be made (morning, afternoon, evening, all)
3. Category to which the suggestion *approximately* belongs (body, diet, soul, mind)

Devices and orientation: should run on currently supported iPhones and iPads in a portrait-only orientation.
